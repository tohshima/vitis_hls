# nand2tetris CPU Implementation with Vitis HLS

## Project Overview

This project aims to implement the nand2tetris CPU using high-level synthesis with Vitis HLS. While the ultimate goal is to run on an FPGA, the current focus is on evaluating various implementations through simulation.

## Objectives

1. Deepen understanding of the nand2tetris CPU architecture
2. Master high-level synthesis techniques using Vitis HLS
3. Compare and evaluate different implementation methods

## Current Status

- [ ] Project conception
- [ ] Basic CPU structure design
- [ ] Initial implementation with Vitis HLS

## Future Plans

1. Implement basic CPU functions using Vitis HLS
2. Verify operation and evaluate performance through simulation
3. Compare different implementation methods and optimize
4. FPGA implementation (future goal)

## Technologies Used

- Vitis HLS
- C++
- FPGA (planned for future use)
